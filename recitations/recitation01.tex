\section{Team Problem: A Mystery}
A certain cabal within the 6.042 course staff is plotting to make the final
exam \emph{ridiculously hard}. ("Problem 1.  Prove that the axioms of
mathematics are complete and consistent. Express your answer in Mayan
hieroglyphics.") The only way to stop their evil plan is to determine exactly
who is in the cabal. The course staff consists of nine people:
\begin{equation*} \lbrace \text{Oscar}, \text{Stav}, \text{Darren},
\text{Patrice}, \text{David}, \text{Nick}, \text{Martyn}, \text{Tom} \rbrace
\end{equation*}
The cabal is a subset of the nine people. A membership roster has been found and appears
below, but it is deviously encrypted in logic notation. The predicate $iscabal$ indicates who is
in the cabal; that is, $incabal(x)$ is true if and only if $x$ is a member. Translate each statement
below into English and deduce who is in the cabal.

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
	\item \label{itm:1} $\exists x\ \exists y\ \exists z\ \left( x \neq y \land x \neq z \land y \neq z \land incabal(x) \land incabal(y) \land incabal(z) \right)$
\medbreak
	There are at least three people in the cabal.
\item \label{itm:2} $\lnot \left( incabal(\text{Stav}) \land incabal(\text{David})\right)$
\medbreak
	At least one of Stav or David are \textit{not} in the cabal.
	\begin{center}
	$\Updownarrow$
	\end{center}
	Stav and David cannot both be in the cabal.
\medbreak
	\item \label{itm:3} $(incabal(\text{Martyna}) \lor incabal(\text{Patrice})) \implies \forall x\ incabal(x)$
\medbreak
	If at least one person isn't in the cabal, then Martyna and Patrice are textit{not} in the cabal.
\medbreak
\item \label{itm:4} $incabal(\text{Stav}) \implies incabal(\text{David})$
\medbreak
	If Stav is in the cabal, then David is in the cabal, too.
	\begin{center}
	$\Updownarrow$
	\end{center}
	If David is \textit{not} in the cabal, then Stav isn't either.
\medbreak
	\item \label{itm:5} $incabal(\text{Darren}) \implies incabal(\text{Martyna})$
\medbreak
	If Darren is in the cabal, then Martyna is in the cabal, too.
	\begin{center}
	$\Updownarrow$
	\end{center}
	If Martyna is \textit{not} in the cabal, then Darren is \textit{not} in the cabal.
\medbreak
	\item \label{itm:6} $\left(incabal(\text{Oscar}) \lor incabal(\text{Nick})\right) \implies \lnot incabal(\text{Tom})$
\medbreak
	If Oscar is in the cabal, then Tom isn't \textit{and} if Nick is in the cabal, then Tom isn't.
	\begin{center}
	$\Updownarrow$
	\end{center}
	If Tom is in the cabal, then neither Oscar nor Nick are in the cabal.
\medbreak
	\item \label{itm:7} $\left(incabal(\text{Oscar}) \lor incabal(\text{David})\right) \implies \lnot incabal(\text{Marten})$
\medbreak
	If Oscar is in the cabal, then Marten isn't \textit{and} if David is in the cabal, then Marten isn't.
	\begin{center}
	$\Updownarrow$
	\end{center}
	If Marten is in the cabal, then neither Oscar nor David are in the cabal.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{solution}

From \ref{itm:2}, we know that at least one of Stav or David are \textit{not}
cabal members, which implies (by \ref{itm:3}) that Martyna and Patrice are not
cabal members. From \ref{itm:4}, we know Stav can't be in the cabal otherwise
David would be, too, yielding a contradiction vis-a-vis \ref{itm:2}. The
contrapositive of \ref{itm:5} exculpates Darren since we already know Martyna
is not a cabal member.

At this stage 5 members are left: $\lbrace \text{Oscar}, \text{Nick},
\text{Marten}, \text{Tom}, \text{David} \rbrace$. If we assume Oscar is in the
cabal, then by \ref{itm:6} and \ref{itm:7}, the cabal must be $\lbrace
\text{Oscar}, \text{Nick}, \text{David} \rbrace$.

We can check that this is the only logical configuration of the cabal by
considering the remaining cases concerning David's and Oscar's memberships:

\begin{addmargin}[1em]{2em}
	\begin{case}
		(Neither David nor Oscar are in the cabal) By necessity, from \ref{itm:1},
		the cabal would be $\lbrace \text{Nick}, \text{Martin}, \text{Tom} \rbrace$.
		Thus, this case cannot be since the contrapositive of \ref{itm:6} is
		contradicted by having Nick and Tom in the cabal together.
	\end{case}

	\begin{case}
		(David is in the cabal but Oscar is not) Again, a contradiction arises in
		this case because at least one of Marten or Tom must be included by
		\ref{itm:2}. If Tom were to be included, Nick would be out (by \ref{itm:6})
		forcing Marten to be included (which cannot be true by the
		contrapositive of \ref{itm:7} ruling out David -- something we assumed for
		this case).
	\end{case}

	\begin{case}
		(Oscar is in the cabal but David is not) This case does not produce a valid
		cabal because the inclusion of Oscar (and David, by assumption), yields a
		contradiction to \ref{itm:2} since Oscar's inclusion only leaves Nick as
		co-conspirator.
	\end{case}
\end{addmargin}
\end{solution}
